        <h1 style="color:goldenrod">Goldenrod-Colored Header</h1>
        <p style="font-family:'Courier New', Courier, monospace; color:maroon">Courier-Family Paragraph with Maroon color.</p>

        <h2 style="color:mediumorchid">Second Header that's MediumOrchid</h2>
        <p style="font-size: 200%">Another paragraph at 200%</p>

        <h3 style="text-align: center">Third Header - Centered</h3>
        <p style="color:lightsalmon;font-family: 'Franklin Gothic Medium', 'Arial Narrow', Arial, sans-serif; text-align: center">
        <b>LightSalmon text in the Franklin-Family, centered and bold.</b>
        </p>
        <p><strong>Another, simple, paragraph but strong.</strong></p>
        <p><i>Now the text is Italic</i></p>
        <p><em>Now it's Emphasized! It's basically the same thing, right?</em></p>
        <p><small>Actually, Strong and Emphasized means they're important while Bold and Italic are just fancy schmancy.</small></p>
        <p><mark>Now here's a Mark to get your attention.</mark></p>
        <p><del>Or many a line over the text with Del(ete) is a better idea?</del></p>
        <p><ins>I know! An Ins(erted) line underneath!</ins></p>
        <p>Text can also be <sub>on the down low with sub</sub> or <sup>on the high road with sup</sup>.</p>
        <p>Now here's a quote for ya: <q>I've come to give you HUGS!</q></p>
        <p>And here's one from another site:</p>
        <blockquote cite="http://www.twitter.com/thewishblade">
            Behold my goofs!
        </blockquote>

        <p>But you shouldn't do these things here! You should use CSS for styles!</p>
        <p>Go look at the head section for the link to your CSS. Using HTML will override your CSS style!</p>
        <p>Now go remove background color from the body so the CSS style is used instead. Now the site should be lightblue.</P>

        <p>Now it's time for an abbreviation, like <abbr title="Laughing Out Loud">LOL</abbr>.</p>
