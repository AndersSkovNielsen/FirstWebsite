        <!-- We could do Internal CSS:-->

            h1 {color:blue}
            p {color: red}

        <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
        <!-- This way you can change the look of a site with one file!
        You can write this file in any text editor, it MUST NOT contain HTML code, and must be saved as a .css extension-->

    <!-- The meriad of examples below are Inline CSS, which trumps Internal/External CSS settings:-->
    <body>
        <h1 style="color:goldenrod">Goldenrod-Colored Header</h1>
        <p style="font-family:'Courier New', Courier, monospace; color:maroon">Courier-Family Paragraph with Maroon color.</p>

        <h2 style="color:mediumorchid">Second Header that's MediumOrchid</h2>
        <p style="font-size: 200%">Another paragraph at 200%</p>

        <h3 style="text-align: center">Third Header - Centered</h3>
        <p style="color:lightsalmon;font-family: 'Franklin Gothic Medium', 'Arial Narrow', Arial, sans-serif; text-align: center">
        <b>LightSalmon text in the Franklin-Family, centered and bold.</b>
        </p>
        <p><strong>Another, simple, paragraph but strong.</strong></p>
        <p><i>Now the text is Italic</i></p>
        <p><em>Now it's Emphasized! It's basically the same thing, right?</em></p>
        <p><small>Actually, Strong and Emphasized means they're important while Bold and Italic are just fancy schmancy.</small></p>
        <p><mark>Now here's a Mark to get your attention.</mark></p>
        <p><del>Or many a line over the text with Del(ete) is a better idea?</del></p>
        <p><ins>I know! An Ins(erted) line underneath!</ins></p>
        <p>Text can also be <sub>on the down low with sub</sub> or <sup>on the high road with sup</sup>.</p>
        <p>Now here's a quote for ya: <q>I've come to give you HUGS!</q></p>
        <p>And here's one from another site:</p>
        <blockquote cite="http://www.twitter.com/thewishblade">
            Behold my goofs!
        </blockquote>

        <p>But you shouldn't do these things here! You should use CSS for styles!</p>
        <p>Go look at the head section for the link to your CSS. Using HTML will override your CSS style!</p>
        <p>Now go remove background color from the body so the CSS style is used instead. Now the site should be lightblue.</P>

        <p>Now it's time for an abbreviation, like <abbr title="Laughing Out Loud">LOL</abbr>.</p>

        a random example: <b>IMMA GO BOOM!</b>

        <p style="border:2px solid Tomato">Here's an example of a 2px Tomato border.</p>

        <h1 style="background-color:rgb(255, 99, 71);">
            Here's an example of color with RGB values.<br>
            Here you set each value of Red, Green, Blue from 0-255.<br>
            All 0 is Black and all 255 is White.</h1>
        <h1 style="background-color:#ff6347;">
            And another with HEX values.<br>
            Here you set rr, gg, and bb to values from 00-ff.<br>
            Thusly, #ff0000 is the same as 255, 00, 00 with RGB.</h1>
        <h1 style="background-color:hsl(9, 100%, 64%);">
            Also one with HSL values!<br>
            Now we're getting fancy with hue, saturation, and lightness.<br>
            Hue (color shade) is a color wheel from 0-360. 0 is Red, 120 is Green. 240 is Blue.<br>
            Saturation (intensity of color) is a percentage value with 0% being a shade of grey and 100% being full color.<br>
            Lightness (how much light you provide) is also a percentage value with 0% being Black, 50% being neither, and 100% being White.
        </h1>

        <h1 style="background-color:rgba(255, 99, 71, 0.5);">Even one with RGBA values for "transparency"!</h1>
        <h1 style="background-color:hsla(9, 100%, 64%, 0.5);">Same goes for this example with HSLA values.</h1>
        <h1>Both of the above are like RGB/HSL but with an additional Alpha.<br>At 0.0 it's fully transparent and at 1.0 it's not transparent at all.</h1>
